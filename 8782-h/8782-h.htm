<h2>CANTO VII</h2>
<br>

<p>"AH me! O Satan! Satan!" loud exclaim'd<br>
Plutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm:<br>
And the kind sage, whom no event surpris'd,<br>
To comfort me thus spake: "Let not thy fear<br>
Harm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none<br>
To hinder down this rock thy safe descent."<br>
Then to that sworn lip turning, "Peace!" &nbsp;he cried,<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/07-075.jpg"><img alt="07-075b.jpg (52K)" src="images/07-075b.jpg" height="395" width="497"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

"Curs'd wolf! thy fury inward on thyself<br>
Prey, and consume thee! Through the dark profound<br>
Not without cause he passes. &nbsp;So 't is will'd<br>
On high, there where the great Archangel pour'd<br>
Heav'n's vengeance on the first adulterer proud."<br>
<br>As sails full spread and bellying with the wind<br>
Drop suddenly collaps'd, if the mast split;<br>
So to the ground down dropp'd the cruel fiend.<br>
<br>Thus we, descending to the fourth steep ledge,<br>
Gain'd on the dismal shore, that all the woe<br>
Hems in of all the universe. &nbsp;Ah me!<br>
Almighty Justice! in what store thou heap'st<br>
New pains, new troubles, as I here beheld!<br>
Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this?<br>
<br>E'en as a billow, on Charybdis rising,<br>
Against encounter'd billow dashing breaks;<br>
Such is the dance this wretched race must lead,<br>
Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found,<br>
From one side and the other, with loud voice,<br>
Both roll'd on weights by main forge of their breasts,<br>
Then smote together, and each one forthwith<br>
Roll'd them back voluble, turning again,<br>
Exclaiming these, "Why holdest thou so fast?"<br>
Those answering, "And why castest thou away?"<br>
So still repeating their despiteful song,<br>
They to the opposite point on either hand<br>
Travers'd the horrid circle: then arriv'd,<br>
Both turn'd them round, and through the middle space<br>
Conflicting met again. &nbsp;At sight whereof<br>
I, stung with grief, thus spake: "O say, my guide!<br>
What race is this? &nbsp;Were these, whose heads are shorn,<br>
On our left hand, all sep'rate to the church?"<br>
<br>He straight replied: "In their first life these all<br>
In mind were so distorted, that they made,<br>
According to due measure, of their wealth,<br>
No use. &nbsp;This clearly from their words collect,<br>
Which they howl forth, at each extremity<br>
Arriving of the circle, where their crime<br>
Contrary' in kind disparts them. &nbsp;To the church<br>
Were separate those, that with no hairy cowls<br>
Are crown'd, both Popes and Cardinals, o'er whom<br>
Av'rice dominion absolute maintains."<br>
<br>I then: "Mid such as these some needs must be,<br>
Whom I shall recognize, that with the blot<br>
Of these foul sins were stain'd." &nbsp;He answering thus:<br>
"Vain thought conceiv'st thou. &nbsp;That ignoble life,<br>
Which made them vile before, now makes them dark,<br>
And to all knowledge indiscernible.<br>
Forever they shall meet in this rude shock:<br>
These from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise,<br>
Those with close-shaven locks. &nbsp;That ill they gave,<br>
And ill they kept, hath of the beauteous world<br>
Depriv'd, and set them at this strife, which needs<br>
No labour'd phrase of mine to set if off.<br>
Now may'st thou see, my son! how brief, how vain,<br>
The goods committed into fortune's hands,<br>
For which the human race keep such a coil!<br>
Not all the gold, that is beneath the moon,<br>
Or ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls<br>
Might purchase rest for one." &nbsp;I thus rejoin'd:<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/07-079.jpg"><img alt="07-079b.jpg (54K)" src="images/07-079b.jpg" height="413" width="494"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<br>"My guide! of thee this also would I learn;<br>
This fortune, that thou speak'st of, what it is,<br>
Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world?"<br>
<br>He thus: "O beings blind! what ignorance<br>
Besets you? &nbsp;Now my judgment hear and mark.<br>
He, whose transcendent wisdom passes all,<br>
The heavens creating, gave them ruling powers<br>
To guide them, so that each part shines to each,<br>
Their light in equal distribution pour'd.<br>
By similar appointment he ordain'd<br>
Over the world's bright images to rule.<br>
Superintendence of a guiding hand<br>
And general minister, which at due time<br>
May change the empty vantages of life<br>
From race to race, from one to other's blood,<br>
Beyond prevention of man's wisest care:<br>
Wherefore one nation rises into sway,<br>
Another languishes, e'en as her will<br>
Decrees, from us conceal'd, as in the grass<br>
The serpent train. &nbsp;Against her nought avails<br>
Your utmost wisdom. &nbsp;She with foresight plans,<br>
Judges, and carries on her reign, as theirs<br>
The other powers divine. &nbsp;Her changes know<br>
Nore intermission: by necessity<br>
She is made swift, so frequent come who claim<br>
Succession in her favours. &nbsp;This is she,<br>
So execrated e'en by those, whose debt<br>
To her is rather praise; they wrongfully<br>
With blame requite her, and with evil word;<br>
But she is blessed, and for that recks not:<br>
Amidst the other primal beings glad<br>
Rolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults.<br>
Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe<br>
Descending: for each star is falling now,<br>
That mounted at our entrance, and forbids<br>
Too long our tarrying." &nbsp;We the circle cross'd<br>
To the next steep, arriving at a well,<br>
That boiling pours itself down to a foss<br>
Sluic'd from its source. &nbsp;Far murkier was the wave<br>
Than sablest grain: and we in company<br>
Of the' inky waters, journeying by their side,<br>
Enter'd, though by a different track, beneath.<br>
Into a lake, the Stygian nam'd, expands<br>
The dismal stream, when it hath reach'd the foot<br>
Of the grey wither'd cliffs. &nbsp;Intent I stood<br>
To gaze, and in the marish sunk descried<br>
A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks<br>
Betok'ning rage. &nbsp;They with their hands alone<br>
Struck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet,<br>
Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/07-083.jpg"><img alt="07-083b.jpg (52K)" src="images/07-083b.jpg" height="407" width="493"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<br>The good instructor spake; "Now seest thou, son!<br>
The souls of those, whom anger overcame.<br>
This too for certain know, that underneath<br>
The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs<br>
Into these bubbles make the surface heave,<br>
As thine eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turn.<br>
Fix'd in the slime they say: 'Sad once were we<br>
In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,<br>
Carrying a foul and lazy mist within:<br>
Now in these murky settlings are we sad.'<br>
Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats.<br>
But word distinct can utter none." &nbsp;Our route<br>
Thus compass'd we, a segment widely stretch'd<br>
Between the dry embankment, and the core<br>
Of the loath'd pool, turning meanwhile our eyes<br>
Downward on those who gulp'd its muddy lees;<br>
Nor stopp'd, till to a tower's low base we came.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="8"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO VIII</h2>
<br>

<p>MY theme pursuing, I relate that ere<br>
We reach'd the lofty turret's base, our eyes<br>
Its height ascended, where two cressets hung<br>
We mark'd, and from afar another light<br>
Return the signal, so remote, that scarce<br>
The eye could catch its beam. &nbsp;I turning round<br>
To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquir'd:<br>
"Say what this means? &nbsp;and what that other light<br>
In answer set? &nbsp;what agency doth this?"<br>
<br>"There on the filthy waters," he replied,<br>
"E'en now what next awaits us mayst thou see,<br>
If the marsh-gender'd fog conceal it not."<br>
<br>Never was arrow from the cord dismiss'd,<br>
That ran its way so nimbly through the air,<br>
As a small bark, that through the waves I spied<br>
Toward us coming, under the sole sway<br>
Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud:<br>
"Art thou arriv'd, fell spirit?"&mdash;"Phlegyas, Phlegyas,<br>
This time thou criest in vain," my lord replied;<br>
"No longer shalt thou have us, but while o'er<br>
The slimy pool we pass." &nbsp;As one who hears<br>
Of some great wrong he hath sustain'd, whereat<br>
Inly he pines; so Phlegyas inly pin'd<br>
In his fierce ire. &nbsp;My guide descending stepp'd<br>
Into the skiff, and bade me enter next<br>
Close at his side; nor till my entrance seem'd<br>
The vessel freighted. &nbsp;Soon as both embark'd,<br>
Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow,<br>
More deeply than with others it is wont.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/08-087.jpg"><img alt="08-087b.jpg (50K)" src="images/08-087b.jpg" height="408" width="490"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<br>While we our course o'er the dead channel held.<br>
One drench'd in mire before me came, and said;<br>
"Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?"<br>
<br>I answer'd: "Though I come, I tarry not;<br>
But who art thou, that art become so foul?"<br>
<br>"One, as thou seest, who mourn:" he straight replied.<br>
<br>To which I thus: "In mourning and in woe,<br>
Curs'd spirit! tarry thou. I know thee well,<br>
E'en thus in filth disguis'd." &nbsp;Then stretch'd he forth<br>
Hands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage<br>
Aware, thrusting him back: "Away! down there,<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/08-089.jpg"><img alt="08-089b.jpg (48K)" src="images/08-089b.jpg" height="552" width="356"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

"To the' other dogs!" &nbsp;then, with his arms my neck<br>
Encircling, kiss'd my cheek, and spake: "O soul<br>
Justly disdainful! blest was she in whom<br>
Thou was conceiv'd!  He in the world was one<br>
For arrogance noted; to his memory<br>
No virtue lends its lustre; even so<br>
Here is his shadow furious. &nbsp;There above<br>
How many now hold themselves mighty kings<br>
Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire,<br>
Leaving behind them horrible dispraise!"<br>
<br>I then: "Master! him fain would I behold<br>
Whelm'd in these dregs, before we quit the lake."<br>
<br>He thus: "Or ever to thy view the shore<br>
Be offer'd, satisfied shall be that wish,<br>
Which well deserves completion." &nbsp;Scarce his words<br>
Were ended, when I saw the miry tribes<br>
Set on him with such violence, that yet<br>
For that render I thanks to God and praise<br>
"To Filippo Argenti:" cried they all:<br>
And on himself the moody Florentine<br>
Turn'd his avenging fangs. &nbsp;Him here we left,<br>
Nor speak I of him more. &nbsp;But on mine ear<br>
Sudden a sound of lamentation smote,<br>
Whereat mine eye unbarr'd I sent abroad.<br>
<br>And thus the good instructor: "Now, my son!<br>
Draws near the city, that of Dis is nam'd,<br>
With its grave denizens, a mighty throng."<br>
<br>I thus: "The minarets already, Sir!<br>
There certes in the valley I descry,<br>
Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire<br>
Had issu'd." &nbsp;He replied: "Eternal fire,<br>
That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame<br>
Illum'd; as in this nether hell thou seest."<br>
<br>We came within the fosses deep, that moat<br>
This region comfortless. &nbsp;The walls appear'd<br>
As they were fram'd of iron. &nbsp;We had made<br>
Wide circuit, ere a place we reach'd, where loud<br>
The mariner cried vehement: "Go forth!<br>
The' entrance is here!" &nbsp;Upon the gates I spied<br>
More than a thousand, who of old from heaven<br>
Were hurl'd. &nbsp;With ireful gestures, "Who is this,"<br>
They cried, "that without death first felt, goes through<br>
The regions of the dead?" &nbsp;My sapient guide<br>
Made sign that he for secret parley wish'd;<br>
Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus<br>
They spake: "Come thou alone; and let him go<br>
Who hath so hardily enter'd this realm.<br>
Alone return he by his witless way;<br>
If well he know it, let him prove. &nbsp;For thee,<br>
Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark<br>
Hast been his escort." Now bethink thee, reader!<br>
What cheer was mine at sound of those curs'd words.<br>
I did believe I never should return.<br>
<br>"O my lov'd guide! who more than seven times<br>
Security hast render'd me, and drawn<br>
From peril deep, whereto I stood expos'd,<br>
Desert me not," I cried, "in this extreme.<br>
And if our onward going be denied,<br>
Together trace we back our steps with speed."<br>
<br>My liege, who thither had conducted me,<br>
Replied: "Fear not: for of our passage none<br>
Hath power to disappoint us, by such high<br>
Authority permitted. &nbsp;But do thou<br>
Expect me here; meanwhile thy wearied spirit<br>
Comfort, and feed with kindly hope, assur'd<br>
I will not leave thee in this lower world."<br>
<br>This said, departs the sire benevolent,<br>
And quits me. &nbsp;Hesitating I remain<br>
At war 'twixt will and will not in my thoughts.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/08-093.jpg"><img alt="08-093b.jpg (48K)" src="images/08-093b.jpg" height="402" width="490"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<br>I could not hear what terms he offer'd them,<br>
But they conferr'd not long, for all at once<br>
To trial fled within. &nbsp;Clos'd were the gates<br>
By those our adversaries on the breast<br>
Of my liege lord: excluded he return'd<br>
To me with tardy steps. &nbsp;Upon the ground<br>
His eyes were bent, and from his brow eras'd<br>
All confidence, while thus with sighs he spake:<br>
"Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?"<br>
Then thus to me: "That I am anger'd, think<br>
No ground of terror: in this trial I<br>
Shall vanquish, use what arts they may within<br>
For hindrance. &nbsp;This their insolence, not new,<br>
Erewhile at gate less secret they display'd,<br>
Which still is without bolt; upon its arch<br>
Thou saw'st the deadly scroll: and even now<br>
On this side of its entrance, down the steep,<br>
Passing the circles, unescorted, comes<br>
One whose strong might can open us this land."</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
